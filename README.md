# Guess-US-State

The Idea was taken from Udemy course "100 days of code" from Angela Yu.

I have perform most part of the code on my own.

Instructions:
- Write any US state.
- If the state exists, the program will write its name in the map.
- I have added other features such as letting the user know when the country does not exist or if it has already been guessed.
- The game will be saved. If a state has been guessed, when the game is opened again, you can continue where you had finished.
